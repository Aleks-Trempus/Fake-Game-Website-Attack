# Fake-Game-Website-Attack
This is documentation on a fake game website attack for simulation and educational purposes. i will be documenting each step. To learn more about the hacker mindset and ways to avoid these attacks

For this i will be using a clone of the popular phone game 2048 (https://2048.ninja/)

The repository used for this exercise is (https://github.com/atilsamancioglu/2048.git)

I first used Digital Ocean as the platform to create a ubuntu server to run the website off of.

Then ran all neccessary updates and installed the apache2 service. 

Then for the exploit im using beef framework (https://github.com/beefproject/beef.git)

To run Beef on an ubuntu server i first needed to install:

RVM (https://github.com/rvm/rvm.git)

install RVM, update it and install the requirements for RVM

Once done then, instal the lastest version of ruby. (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt)
